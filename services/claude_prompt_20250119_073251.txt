Please create a structured itinerary that:
1. Groups activities by day
2. Includes timing for each activity
3. Attempt to fit things within the budget specified
4. Considers activity intensity e.g. i doubt people want to boulder every day of the trip, allow them to experience other things, and proper spacing i.e if activity level 1 then fewer activities per day, if 5 then more
5. Ensure you fill up all the dates in the range specified
6. Accounts for travel time between locations
7. Only include specific locations / activities, i.e. for breaks / travel just leave blank & no need to generate for example:
    do not generate things like:
        "name": "Break",
        "start_time": "11:00", 
        "duration": "1 hour",
        "type": "break"
8. If running out of tokens, reduce activities but complete the JSON!!! ALWAYS COMPLETE THE JSON (IMPORTANT)
9. Try to always include the most iconic places of the city if possible

Format the response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "days": [
        {
            "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
            "activities": [
                {
                    "id": "unique location id",
                    "name": "Activity name",
                    "start": "HH:MM",
                    "duration": "X hours",
                    "type": "activity/restaurant/cafe"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
